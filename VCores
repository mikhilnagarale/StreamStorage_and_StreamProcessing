VCores- Virtual Cores

VCores are like Virtually set/configured cores. These are usually set by application administrator.
In Hadoop VCores are set by an Administraor in yarn-site.xml file.
General recommendationto set vcores is equal to physical cores (Based on CPU like dual-core, quad-core,octa-core, etc...)
But an Administrator can increase the values of the VCores if the speed of the processor is faster (Eg. 1.3GHz, 2.6GHZ, etc...)
