This question arisesed in my mind when I think for whats the difference between DataFrame & DataSets in Spark & which one is better & why?
So the answer is DataFrame is not typesafe & DataSet is typesafe.


Then next what is type safety? & why it's so important?

Type -> Data Type
Type safety -> Data Type Safety

when does data type /type safety comes in picture -> when there is a conversion of one data type to another (Eg. int to float) or when operation 
to be performed on one data type are being performed on another or used improper data types for any operations(eg. String+ int -> "2"+4).

why typesafety is important?
-> for each data type language kernal assigns a specific byte of memory. So now operations with improper data types will result in ->
1) either Loss of data.
2) Termination of program.
3) Curruption of data.

So these type of operations of transfering any random bytes to any other bytes causes issues in program & leads to abrupt termination of program.
Hense it's necessary to verify typed operations to avoid later issues.

Type verification types-> 1) Statically typed 2) Dynamically typed
Statically typed - A process of verifying a typed operations at compile time. Eg- Java,C#,Scala.
Dynamically Typed - A process of verifying a typed operations at run time. Eg- Python, Ruby.

How we can say that DataFrame is not type-safe & why DataSet is type-safe? How can you prove it?
